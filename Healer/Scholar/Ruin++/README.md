# Ruin++

Uses Broil if available, else Ruin II if available, else Ruin. Uses skill on target if valid, else on target's target. Length of macro makes execution a bit wobbly, if you are serious about end-game healer DPS, I'd suggest just switching this out for Broil. This is mainly for use with level sync in dungeons.
