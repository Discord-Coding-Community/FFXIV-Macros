# Lustrate

This is a life saver during moments where your tank's HP drops critically low. Lustrate is put at the beginning over Aetherflow so you won't accidentally use your stacks just in case you any left. Best part: both are Off GCD so they can be weaved OR spammed depending on the scenario. You can also use Sacred Soil, Bane or Energy Drain with this. With Sacred Soil you can place it WHILE going through the animation. Perfect for quick mitigation moments.
