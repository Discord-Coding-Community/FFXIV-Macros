# Hotbar Macro Template

This Macro gives you a collapseable Shared Hotbar. Can be edited to have multiple hotbars if preferred.

## Usage

 - Simply replace `[CLASS INITIALS]` with the initials for the class of which you are copying the shared hotbar from.
```cs
ex.
    /hotbar copy BRD 10 share 10
 ```
 - For each new hotbar added make sure replace `[HOTBAR NUMBER]` with the hotbar number.
 - Next, add all of you items to both the shared and unshared versions of the hotbar(s) specified in the Macro and rehide the hotbar(s) specified in the Macro.
 - Once done add the Macro to a visible Shared Hotbar.

## Notes
 - This macro set can be finicky when setting up, so sometimes hiding and unhiding hotbars 9 and 10 before attempting to click the Class Menu Macro may be needed for it to save.
 - Make sure you are making these on the same class that the Class Menu copies the Gear Set Macros from for it to save.
 - Do **NOT** include the brackets `[]` in the Macro.
