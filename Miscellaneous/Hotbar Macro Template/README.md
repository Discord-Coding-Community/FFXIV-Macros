# Hotbar Macro Template

This Macro gives you a collapseable Shared Hotbar. Can be edited to have multiple hotbars if preferred.

## Usage

 - Simply replace `[CLASS INITIALS]` with the initials for the class of which you are copying the shared hotbar from.
    - Example:
    ```cs
        /hotbar copy BRD 10 share 10
    ```
 - For each new hotbar added make sure replace `[HOTBAR NUMBER]` with the hotbar number.
 - Next, add all of you items to both the shared and unshared versions of the hotbar(s) specified in the Macro, then hide, unhide, and re hide the hotbar(s) specified in the Macro.
 - Once done add the Hotbar Macro to a visible shared hotbar.

## Notes

 - This Macro set can be finicky when setting up, so sometimes hiding and unhiding the hotbar(s) specified in the Hotbar Macro before attempting to click it may be needed for it to save.
 - Make sure you are making these on the same class that the Class Menu copies the Gear Set Macros from for it to save.
 - Do **NOT** include the brackets `[]` in the Macro.
