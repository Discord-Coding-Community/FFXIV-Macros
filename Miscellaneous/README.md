This is where Macros that don't use skills or apply to specific classes are to be placed.

The format for these Macro `README.md` files is as follows:

```cs
# [MACRO NAME]

 [DESCRIPTION]

## Usage

 - [DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO SET UP THE MACRO]
 - [A NEW LINE FOR EACH STEP OF THE INSTRUCTIONS]
```

The Folder format for these Macro files is as follows:

```cs
    > [MACRO NAME]
        > data
            - [MACRO NAME].txt
        - README.md
```

### Notes

 Brackets `[]` refer to text to replace. **DO NOT** include the `[]` in the `README.md` file, just replace the necessary fields as instructed.

These Guidelines are in place to keep the repo clean and manageable. So please be sure to abide by them when suggesting new Macro files.

Failure to abide by the above Rules and/or Guildelines will result in said Macro files being deleted and/or rejected.
