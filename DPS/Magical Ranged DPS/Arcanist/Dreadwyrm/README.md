# Dreadwyrm

This macro uses Deathflare if Dreadwyrm Trance is activated and Dreadwyrm Trance if it is not, this is due to Deathflare only being usable in Dreadwyrm Trance , and why "macroerror off" is important. If Bahamut is available it will be summoned. If Bahamut is summoned Enkindle Bahamut will be used.
